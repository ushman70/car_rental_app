# car_rental_app
This was an app I was working on to understand react better. This is a full stack application that is suppose to mimic the functions of apps such as KAYAK or car rental services. Perform the exact same functions as those apps. This app is unfinished, the car react build folder apparently can't be open due to the git coomit that I made in the past. The backend stuff can be seen, for the backend I used express.js and node.js. I used an ORM(Object relational Mapping) to make life alittle easier for fetching information from the DB. The DB used was postgres, JWT's were used for security.
